In the analysis of passing scores when considering both reading and math, we can observe that regardless of budget, Charter schools are significantly more successful in passing rate for both subjects compared to District schools. The District schools can actually be seen to have more total school budget than the Charter schools. 
Interestingly enough, we can also see that schools with a spending range of under $585 per student actually possessed some of the highest overall passing rates as opposed to the schools that spent over $585. All four high schools with budgets under $585 possessed an overall passing percentage above 89%. However, 7 of the 11 schools above the $585 dollar budget per student had overall passing percentages under 54%. 
Another interesting observation we can make is that 7 out of 8 large schools - which are classified by a student body of 2000-5000 - had overall passing rates under 55%. Only one of these schools, Wilson High School, the Charter school, had an overall passing rate above 55% at 90.58%.
